# arkhamdb-docker

`docker compose` wrapper to quickly run a local [arkhamdb](https://arkhamdb.com/) instance.

# Getting started

> **Warning**  
> This is tailored to previewing the card database and images. This is not a production-ready setup, nor does it currently support developing arkhamdb itself.

1. install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. run the following commands in a shell. If your system does not have `make` installed (e.g. on Windows), copy the referenced commands from the `Makefile` and run them manually instead when approriate.

```sh
# 1. clone this git repository to a folder and change to it.
git clone https://github.com/fspoettel/arkhamdb-docker && cd arkhamdb-docker

# 2. Start the containers in one terminal.
docker compose up

# 3. In a second terminal, initialize the database.
#    You only need to do this once on first run.
make init-db

# 4. Import card data.
make import-cards
```

✨ You can now access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Updating cards & images while running

The folders `<repo>/arkhamdb-json-data` and `<repo>/images` are mounted into the running docker container.

Changes to files in the images folder will be visible in the _"Browse"_ view immediately.

In order to update card data or images in the deck builder view, run `make import-cards` again after making changes and confirm the new card data version in the application UI.

## Accessing the internal database

```
type: mysql or mariadb
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 3307
database: symfony
user: symfony_user
password: symfony_password
```

## Creating a user login

1. Register via the application user interface.
2. Connect to the database with a SQL editor (e.g. [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)), using the credentials referenced above.
3. Navigate to the `users` table and find the record pointing to the user you registered.
4. Set the `enabled` field to `1`.
5. You can now login.

## Creating an OAuth app

If you need to develop against ArkhamDB's OAuth gateway, you can create an oauth client by running the following command. By default, this will create a client with `grant_types` set to `["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]`.

```sh
make redirect_uri="<url>" name="<name>" create-oauth-app
```

The command will output the `client_id` and `client_secret`.

Authorization endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/oauth/v2/auth`
